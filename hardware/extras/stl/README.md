The C-clamp is a modified design of the following [desing on printables](https://www.printables.com/model/730655-c-clamp-with-swappable-clamp-ends/files).

It has been adapted to accomodate thicker tables and to interfaces with the low cost leader and follower bases.

For the OpenRB-150 board, the design was tested with M1.7 self-tapping screws, but you should be okay with anything that can fit through the hole in the PCB.
